				<p>Not your average stale investing guide, Robbie Burns puts life and interest into learning various trading strategies. Most of his strategies are largely momentum style plays. And he avoids technical analysis, instead concentrating on market timing, looking at market volumes and current share price proximity to recent highs and lows. He also discusses how he researches the health of companies he buys into.</p>
				<p>His strategies are explained simply such that someone new to investing can readily follow and replicate without too much trouble. Via his online blog he also provides regular updates on his trades and provides the full history of all his historic trades which gives further insights in to how he is playing current market conditions such that you can hopefully learn further from the almost real-time situations in the market! He does however delay putting his trades up on his website by a couple of weeks, so it is probably not wise to blindly follows his trades in most cases.</p>
				<p>This book is so easy to read and follow that it will give you the confidence to jump straight in on some of the strategies, unlike a lot of other investing books where in most instances you feel like you are missing a few key details.</p>
