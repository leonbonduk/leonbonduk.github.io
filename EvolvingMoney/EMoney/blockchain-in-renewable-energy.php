		<h2><strong>NumerAi</strong> the open-source hedge fund </h2>
                <p><strong> Blockchain technology </strong> holds great promise in renewable energy markets. As individual consumers we have some idea of electricity markets work. We may know that if we shop around we get better prices, and if we don’t we won’t. There have also long been 		providers like <strong> Ecotricity </strong> that seek to provide us with electricity from renewable sources. These market mechanisms 		require individuals to act and make decisions. In our busy lives many of us stick with our existing energy providers and shop around only 		periodically. </p>
	<p><strong> Blockchain </strong> and <strong> smart contracts </strong> hold the promise to do this shopping around, and targetting greener 		energy objectives in an automated way continuously. This could be an enabler of great change in energy markets. Several companies have been 		set up with this objective in mind, and they focus primarily on businesses energy needs; but we can think of businesses operating like 		individuals but on a larger scale.</p>
	<p>The change in energy markets could allow greater funding and targetted funding to be provided to renewable energy projects based on the 		changing market incentives.</p>
	<p>There are 5 companies that are spearheading the initiative of blockchain in renewable energy markets. </p>
	<p> 1) WePower </p>
	<p> 2) Powerledger </p>
	<p> 3) Acciona energy & Iberdrola </p>
	<p> 4) The Brooklyn Microgrid </p>
	<p> 5) Sun exchange </p>
	<p>The approaches have similarities. In this article the Lithuania based startup <strong> WePower </strong> is put under the spotlight (they would rather sun light of course). </p>
	<p><strong> WePower </strong> makes use of the ethereum blockchain to provide a ledger of transactions and to create smart contracts between electricity producers and buyers. They call the contracts digitally enabled Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). They provide a 		ethereum smart contract enabled trading platform to buy and sell renewable energy.</p>
	<p>Consumers and producers needs are assessed, and PPAs are drawn up to try to provide the best price for the consumer based on the avaiable producers. <strong> WePower </strong> try to help small clean energy producers enter the market using this technology.</p>
	<p>They have experienced significant growth and attracted a lot of media interest. It’s a fantastic example of how blockchain technology is being used right now to essentially make smart electricity markets.</p>
