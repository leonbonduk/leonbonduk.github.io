		<h2> <strong>NumerAi</strong> the open-source hedge fund </h2>
                <p> Open source is a term we hear from software, where the source code is freely available, but what does this have to do with hedge funds? <p>
                <p> In quant hedge funds teams generate models for technical analysis of stock prices. Algorithms tend to do the larger proportion of the trading rather than a human trader.
                    These algorithms are kept closely guarded, and are not something a normal hedge fund would share, but in the case of NumerAI, it is precisely these algorithms
                    that are shared. <p>		 
		<p> The reason that  <strong>NumerAi</strong> do this is to take advantage of the network effects of having many contributors providing algorithms in a competition format. 
                    The crowd generated algorithms they end up with, are derived by much larger teams than any hedge fund could afford on their own,  and from a community of highly skilled 
                    data scientists. Traditional algorithms used for trading were predominantly statistical models used for price prediction, but the <strong>NumerAi</strong> community  
                    make use of the latest tools in data science and machine learning, an area that Hedge funds are only just breaking into.<p>
                <p> The <strong>NumerAi</strong> team have incentivised the crowd to work for them in a competion based market place, and contributors compete to provide better algorithms. 
                    This costs a lot less money than hiring people to do it. Pay is in a competition format so effectively they only have to pay the winners. Also their workforce 
                    pay to be involved, and effectively crowd fund the hedge fund. It's a very creative solution that harnesses technology and the crowd together.<p>
                <p> It's a bit like <strong>Wikipedia</strong> for technical analysis and stock market prediction models, combined with <strong>Crowdfunder</strong>...  Inspired.<p>
                <p> In the background it uses Cryptocurrency, Blockchain and Smart Contracts to automatically pay everyone providing models, and to compute rankings and performance. Contributors can make a lot of money if they are good.<p>
                <p> For me this is an example of things to come, the rise in importance of algorithms and AI / automation has been much discussed. A much more important trend potentially,
                    at least in the short term, is likely to be the contributions of teams of people and computer algorithms working together... much discussed in the book <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1786074702/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=1786074702&linkCode=as2&tag=evolvingmoney-21&linkId=0980827271bfdad9d3f2c5dc2665cb82">Superminds</a><img src="//ir-uk.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=evolvingmoney-21&l=am2&o=2&a=1786074702" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> 
                    by Thomas W Malone. Numerai is precisely an example of this in action in FinTech.<p>
