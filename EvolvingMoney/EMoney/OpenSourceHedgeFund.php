		<h3>James Day, 5th January 2020</h3>
		<p> NumerAI the open-source hedge fund,  </p>

                <p> Open source is a term we here from software, where the source code is freely available, but what does this have to do with hedge funds? <p>

                <p> In hedge funds quants generate models for technical analysis of stock prices and these models, (algorithms) are what tend to do the larger proprtion of the trading.
                    These algorithms are kept closely guarded, and are not something a normal hedge fund would share, but in the case of NumerAI that it is precisily these tools
                    that are shared. <p>		 

		<p> The reason that NumarAI do this is to take advanatage of the network effects of having many contributors providing algorithms in a competition format. 
                    The crowd generated algorithms they end up with, are derived by much larger teams than any hedge fund could afford on their own,  and from a comminity of highly skilled 
                    data scientists. Traditional algorithms used for trading were predominantly statistical models used for price prediction, but the NumerAI community  
                    make use of the latest tools in data science an machine learning, (an area that Hedge funds are only just breaking into). <p>

                <p> The NumerAI team have incentivised the crowd to work for them in a competion based market place, and contributors compete to provide better algorithms. 
                    This costs a lot less money than hiring people to do it. Pay is in a competition format so effectively they only have to pay the winners. Also their workforce 
                    pay to be involved, and effectively crowd fund the hedge fund. It's a very creative solution that harnesses technology and the crowd together. <p>

                <p> It's a bit like wikipedia for technical analysis and stock market prediction models, combined with Crowdfunder ...  Inspired. <p>

                <p> In the background it uses Cryptocurrency, Blockchain and Smart Contracts, to automatically pay and everyone providing models, and compute rankings and performance. 
                    Contributors can make a lot of money if they are good. <p>

                <p> For me this is an example of things to come, the rise in importance of algorithms and AI / automation has been much discussed. A much more important trend potentially
                    at least in the short term, is likely to be the contributions of teams of people and computer algorithms working together... much discussed in the book Superminds 
                    by Thomas W Malone. Numerai is precisely an example of this in action in FinTech. <p>
