		<h3>Leon Bond, 6th January 2020</h3>

		<p>Join me on a dual journey of maximising free cash obtained from cashback offers, such as cashback websites and banking sign up bonuses, and then taking that free cash tand growing it even further by trading on the stock market using the fee free trading app, Freetrade. I intend to keep this blog fairly up to date with my transactions each week so please keep coming back.</p>
		<p>Freetrade lends itself to trading in small amounts due to it’s lack of fees as well as allowing higher frequency trading so I thought it would be interesting to actually see how much it is possible to grow the free cash from trading on a mixture of shares that have caught my eye and discussed in other articles in this blog, as well as trading on a few opportunities that I have not had time to research fully or not certain on the risk-reward potential but think worth a shot since I am trading with free cash. I am hoping trading with free cash will also remove some nervousness to trade that you get when you have more skin in the game so it will also be interesting to see how this portfolio performs against my more risk adverse portfolio. To find out more about the Freetrade app then take a look at this article.</p>
		<h2>Free cash</h2>
		<p>So far I have received £80.91 of free cash in the space of a couple of months, find out more below:</p>
		<p>7/1/2010: Received £42.46 from Topcashback website on cashback from about two months of online purchases! Find out more in this article. Or use the following referral link and currently we both receive £7.50 if you sign up and earn £10 of other cashback!</p>
		<p>3/1/2020: Received £6.45 from Freetrade and invested by Freetrade in a Pearson share for referring a friend to Freetrade. Email me at following link and  if I have a referral invite available I will pass it on if you are serious about setting up an account:</p>
		<p>31/12/2019: Received £17 for being referred to Quidco cashback website.  Find out more in this article. Or use the following referral link and currently we both receive £10 if you sign up and earn £5 of other cashback!</p>
		<p>25/12/2019: Received £15 for being referred to Monese challenger bank account.  Find out more in this article. Or use the following referral link and currently we both receive £20 if you sign up to Monese!</p>
		<h2>Free Trading</h2>
		<p>Performance: Invested funds only 0.2% down due to Pearson and BT but early days so nothing  to worry about yet. Ceres Power’s share price however still appears to have some momentum behind it and so the overall portfolio is relatively break even currently.</p>
		<p>Trades:</p>
		<p>3/1/2020: Freetrade allocated a free share in Pearson for referring a friend. I don't know too much about the company, but appears to be near 10 year lows and going through a restructure to simplify the business so appears to be a contrarian play that is potentially worth a gamble so I have retained…</p>
		<p>2/1/2020: Bought 6 shares in Ceres Power at a cost of £16.24. There seems to be some strong momentum on this share, tapping into the carbon neutral theme, possibly overinflated price, but will try and ride the momentum for a while.</p>
		<p>30/12/2019: Bought 7 shares in BT at a cost of £13.76. After the election result, risks of nationalisation has fallen away, with 7%+ dividend yield I think BT should still appreciate further from price at time of my article.</p>
