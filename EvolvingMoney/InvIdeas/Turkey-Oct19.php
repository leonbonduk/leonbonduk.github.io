		<h3>Leon Bond, 17th October 2019, HSBC ETFs plc MSCI Turkey (HTRY), Price £1.69</h3>
		<p><img src="https://www.evolving.money/Images/turkey-flag-wrinkled.jpg" alt="Wrinkled Turkish Flag" title="Turkish Delight" style="width:300px;height:auto;float: left; margin: 1%; padding: 1%;"/> </p>
		<p>Since Turkey's incursion into Syria a few days ago  Turkey's stock market has fallen to fresh lows with the MSCI Turky index down 18% since 30th September! It remains 13% higher than the lows seen in May this year however.</p> 
		<p>With a ceasefie now negotiated by Trump as of today, and the Kurds having allowed the Syrian government forces up to protect the border the markets could now drift back up to their annual highs since just a couple of weeks ago.</p>
		<h2>Other market details</h2>
		<p>Turkey's market was already very cheap before this retracement, due in most part to the political turmoil of the Turkish president's regime, President Erdoğan. The Turkish MSCI index was following simlar market trends to the general MSCI EMerging Markets Index from 2004 right up to 2016. Since shortly before the attempted coup in 2016, however, the Turkish market has diverged considerably from the rest of the emerging markets, diverging by approx 50%.</p>
		<p>At 30th September the MSCI Turkey index had a P/E ratio of 8.2 and a forward P/E ratio of 6.3! This compares to the MSCI Emerging Markets index which had P/E ratio of 13.2 and a forward P/E ratio of 11.9. Therefore the Turkish market is trading at approximately half the value of other emerging markets...</p>
		<h2>High risk opportunity</h2>
		<p>Although this is obviously a high risk play given the current Syrian situation, the market valuations provides some comfort that even if short term bet does not pan out, if you can hold for longer term then this should at least return to slightly more sensible valuations although coming fully back in line with the other emerging markets is unlikely for the foreseeable future until the internal political situation in Turkey settles down also.</p>

<p>How to trade:<br><br>The best and cheapest way to play a short term market opportunity like this is via an ETF, which are usually passively managed and so have low management fees. As they are traded on a stock exchange they usually also have a smaller spread when buying or selling compared to a standard unit trust fund. It is also best to make sure a reputable provider is choosen to ensure counter party risk is minimised, i.e. risk that they will go bust is minimised. Our favourite way to play the Turkish market is through HSBC's ETF "HSBC ETFs plc MSCI Turkey (HTRY)" which attempts to replciate the performance of the MSCI Turkey Index and charges a management fee of only 0.6%.<br><br>MSCI, once part of Morgan Stanley, have provided global equity indexes since 1969 and are widely used as benchmarks for various markets by financial professionals. This ETF attempts to track the index through physcial replication, in other words it directly holds the securties that make up the index. This method helps reduce risks compared to synthetic replication where there is increased counter party risk due to synthetic replication involving derviatives with other parties. <br><br>You should be able to buy this ETF through most online brokers in a similar manner to a normal company share, just search for the ticker HTRY on your broker's trading screen.
